President Hotel,4,"Too bad about the furnishings of the rooms","17th April 2025",True,"Hotel located in the modern part of the city but not far from the historic center. Well-designed, well-kept and comfortable common areas. Staff super helpful, attentive, smiling and polite. Great breakfast, rich in quantity and variety of food. Cozy spa, nice indoor pool area. Bar on the 40th floor well stocked, offers a beautiful view of the city and offers excellent cocktails. The only flaw, in my opinion, is the furniture in the rooms, a bit dated and ruined. Great bathroom sponges, bed comfortable enough",Standard Double,Solo Leisure,yes
President Hotel,3,"My expectation compared to previous times was not met","17th April 2025",True,"The hotel has come of age ,even if no serious technical defects were detectable. The breakfast buffet in the former Marriott was in a class of its own. Not with comparable to today's quality. The spa area is exemplary and varied. Services top. Top location, and a beautiful panorama towards the Palace of Culture.",Deluxe Room,Couple Leisure,no
President Hotel,2,"They did not solve noises problems during the night","7th March 2025",True,"The room is wonderful but we had a bad experience. The guy at the room next to ours hired a hooker and she was shouting like crazy in the middle of the night. We called downstairs a couple of times but they did not solve the problem. Very bad attention.",Standard Twin,Family Leisure,no
President Hotel,1,"A NIGHTMARE OF A HOTEL!","5th March 2025",True,"This hotel is an absolute disaster! I had booked a specific room, yet they gave me a disabled-access room without my consent and told me there were no other options available. This is completely unacceptable! As if that wasn‚Äôt enough, they didn‚Äôt take a deposit at check-in, but once I got to my room, they called me and basically threatened me, saying, 'If you don‚Äôt pay the deposit, we will lock your minibar.' Is this how they treat their guests? Absolutely disgraceful! And the worst part? At 6:45 AM, they were vacuuming loudly right outside my door! How is anyone supposed to get a good night‚Äôs sleep in such a chaotic environment? This place lacks professionalism, customer service, and basic hospitality. I would never recommend this hotel to anyone! Stay away!",Accessible Room,Solo Leisure,no

We will definitely return to this hotel.",Panorama Room,Couple Leisure,yes
President Hotel,4,"Great hotel!","22nd October 2024",True,"Lovely hotel with great views. Good beds and lovely shower!

President Hotel,2,"Bad","11th November 2024",False,"The hotel tends to hold on thr security deposit for 3 weeks or more and keep making excuses.

President Hotel,1,"Terrible...","22nd September 2023",False,"Terrible hotel! The staff was unfriendly and discriminatory, showing a complete lack of professionalism and courtesy.

President Hotel,2,"Rest at the President Hotel. Warsaw","21st August 2023",True,"Relaxed for the N year. Got all the rotavirus. It's not just us that's visible. Roommates next door, too. He must be walking there. Breakfast's not great. It's cold in the room - called to adjust. The restaurant is like a dining room. Some of the products were expired. Don't go there again! From the plus side, location.",Standard Twin,Family Leisure,no
President Hotel,5,"A great hotel for a city break","14th December 2023",True,"We spent New Year's Eve 2024 in Warsaw. The choice of hotel was a stroke of luck. The staff is excellent, the breakfast one of the best we have ever had. Plus swimming pool and bar on the 40th floor. It's great. The hotel is just over 2 km from the old town. But is easy to cope with, or you take the inexpensive bus. Directly opposite the hotel is a large shopping centre and the Centralna train station with direct train connections from Berlin. Parking by car in the underground car park is not problematic (50,- ‚Ç¨ per day). On site there are great German city tours with Antoni (TrippAdvisor) to recommend. To marvel at the excessively illuminated city and parks at Christmas time, to enjoy the original Polish cuisine.",Deluxe Room,Couple Leisure,yes
President Hotel,4,"Great for vegans","12th November 2023",True,"I've stayed at this hotel a few times over the years under previous and new management and recommend it highly. They always serve a wide selection of veggie and vegan food at breakfast and the staff are very friendly and helpful. The new spa is lovely, although could do with a manicurist and generally some of the rooms could do with a bit of a refurb.",Standard Room,Solo Leisure,yes
President Hotel,5,"Good experience in Warsaw","6th July 2023",True,"Good central location. Clean, nice staff, easy access. I exercise so it was a convenient jog to the old city and back to the hotel. The gym is one of the better ones I have used during my many years on traveling abroad for business. Public transpiration is right there and if you are a Starbucks fan there is one about a a minute walk from the hotel. Would highly recommend it. I plan to bring my wife back for a visit to Warsaw and stay at the Presidential.",Executive Room,Business,yes
President Hotel,5,"Highly recommended hotel","4th July 2023",False,"Excellent location, very friendly service, clean and well-equipped rooms, large and comfortable beds, well-equipped coffee shop, exquisite and varied breakfast, very much enjoy the hotel.",Deluxe Room,Couple Leisure,yes
President Hotel,4,"Very pleasant","1st September 2023",True,"Stayed here for 2 nights on business. A nice hotel in a good central location, really helpful staff on reception & all very easy. No complaints, would certainly stay here again. Room on the 33rd floor so good views of the city & a nice bar at the top too",Executive Room,Business,yes
President Hotel,5,"Awesome stay, amazing staff","28th August 2023",True,"Fantastic stay, I felt really well looked after, every member of staff was amazing. The dinner at the hotel, whilst a bit more expensive than other restaurants, was a real dining experience, amazing steak perfectly cooked. The reception was always super helpful. The room was always super clean, every day the room would be made up, the attention to detail was incredible, even arranging the bits and pieces I left in the bathroom and on the bed to look tidy. The spa was super clean and a good selection of places to relax. Great location for public transport too, only a minute to the central transport hub.",Executive Suite,Solo Leisure,yes
President Hotel,4,"Top hotel","21st August 2023",True,"Beautiful hotel, very centrally located. Nice atmospheric chic lobby. Breakfast is tasteful with plenty of tables available. Although the hotel rooms may be renovated, it was otherwise an excellent hotel to stay. Very good service from the staff.",Deluxe Room,Couple Leisure,yes
President Hotel,5,"Must VISIT!","19th August 2023",True,"Yes, this is old hotel (70's/80's) and need some rooms refurbishment. However, the staff, food, location is exceptional - there is no doubt about the 5* rating and price to the quality. The views from the restaurant on 2nd floor during breakfast, or if You choose Panorama Sky Bar on 40th floor are incredible. On top of that there is the new SPA and GYM service run by third party company (OMNI), refurbished to the top level! No need pre-booking, no need to pay if You are hotel guest - enjoy the peaceful atmosphere with the world class standard.",Panorama Room,Family Leisure,yes
President Hotel,3,"Iconic Hotel","17th August 2023",True,"This big Marriott hotel in Warsaw is located in a tall tower building by the Central train station and close to the Palace of Culture and Science building. Reception was cold, and they took 200 zlotys from my card just in case I spend something. I didn't spend anything, so far I haven't received back my money. I got a nice room with city views. Unfortunately some furniture was old and not well cared. They keep new testament and mormon books in your bed side table, which I find unacceptable. Breakfast is a jungle. People fight for the tables, and strange people might sit with you at some point, if there is no other place around.",Standard Room,Solo Leisure,no
President Hotel,2,"Bad Experience","15th August 2023",True,"Rude front desk officer at the time of check in. Inspite of informing in advance and requesting for a shower rather than bath tub, I was asked for more money just to upgrade a room with shower. Pity this is no more a Marriott else as a member they would have acknowledged my request. 200 PLN charged in the name of refundable deposit has not been credited back till date since last 23 days. Inspite of sending several mails & reminders, the only casual revert i received 2 days back is they are processing it. I am wondering if i had not been sending mails, the Hotel would have slept on it without any action. I want to know will they will give me interest for holding my money without any reason for that long. Beware guests. If all that is ok, and proximity to Station is all what you seek, you may consider staying but for me never again.",Standard Room,Business,no
President Hotel,5,"My warmest recommendations.","14th July 2023",True,"Warszawas bedste hotel. Delicious clean rooms with stunning views as far as the eye reaches over the city. Always polite service whether it's the piccolo, the cleaning staff or the waitress behind the desk. I have been using the hotel for almost a decade and there is a reason: the service is top!",Deluxe Room,Solo Leisure,yes
President Hotel,4,"A nice hotel with a great location","13th July 2023",True,"Overall, a totally OK Marriott hotel located in the center of Warsaw. Walking distance to the city center and to the business districts, in case you are there for work. The building has quite a long history and it is a bit visible that it is a bit old design. However, they have done a renovation not long ago, which is apparently still ongoing as the pool was closed for renovation. As a Titanium member, an upgrade was given to a suite with perfect views of the whole of Warsaw. Executive lounge is available and has quite good space. Perhaps a little better food and variety could be offered. The bar on the top floor is nice and have a great view over the whole Warsaw. Definetly worth a visit if you stay at this hotel.",Executive Suite,Business,yes
President Hotel,4,"Solid option in Warsaw","12th July 2023",True,"This is the former Marriott hotel and the old sign is still at the rooftop. Everything is solid and functional. Room is neat and pleasant with a nice city view. Staff is helpful and location unparalleled. The central railway station is right opposite the hotel as well as a large shopping mall and some nice restaurants. Price is very good.",Standard Room,Business,yes
President Hotel,1,"No Longer a Marriott","11th July 2023",True,"We had a reservation for this hotel for November, 2024. We received an email from Marriott Corporation, that as of August 6, 2024 this would no longer be a Marriott property and not affiliated with Marriott at all. We canceled our reservation",N/A,Family Leisure,no
President Hotel,4,"Great hotel","30th October 2023",True,"Stayed here for a couple of days whilst in Warsaw. It is very handy for the station and is in a busy area. Rooms are spacious and comfortable and the staff were great. Breakfast offers a very good choice and was a relaxed atmosphere. Bar area comfortable and the service was excellent. All in all a good hotel",Standard Double,Couple Leisure,yes
President Hotel,2,"Worst 5 star experience ever","26th October 2023",True,"I have stayed in many 5 stars hotel in my life, mostly belonging to former Starwoods Group and then, after it was taken over, to Marriot Group, including all of them in Warsaw. Marriot is by far the worst of all of them. I understand that it is one of the oldest 5 star hotels in Warsaw, but there are no excuses when we talk about 5 stars and the expectations behind it. The worst thing about this hotel is that there is completely no noise insulation and even when you are on a really high floor you can hear the street noise as if it you were just in the middle of it. Racing cars and motorcycles( btw - is there any police in Warsaw???), trams, ambulances- I just couldn‚Äôt believe how loudly I could hear it on the 33th floor. This was not the greatest night sleep experience after a very long flight and jet lag. Going further, the room we got was so small that we could barely fit with our bags. I have never had such small room in any supposedly very good hotel. The bathroom was made for midgets, my husband could not turn around without hitting something. Carpets, furniture, all worn out. The only good thing about our stay was proximity to Z≈Çote Trasy shopping mall and railway station. And this is why I am giving the hotel two stars.",Standard Room,Family Leisure,no
President Hotel,5,"Amazing Hotel - The ideal location.","21st October 2023",True,"Amazing hotel, and the best location. We had an amazing stay at the Warsaw Marriott Hotel. The rooms were spacious and clean and our room had an amazing view. The staff was helpful and kind. Opposite the hotel, there is a big shopping mall and the main train station.",Deluxe Room,Couple Leisure,yes
President Hotel,4,"Centrally located, right in front of the train station and the cultural center of Warsaw","9th October 2023",True,"A centrally located hotel with good amenities and descent size of a room. It is a pity that the swimming pool was not working at the time I stayed at the hotel but trust new guests will enjoy the renovated spa area in a few months time. The view from my room on the 37th floor was amazing. The hotel offers a good breakfast with a vast selection of food and beverages. Overall a good impression although the hotel requires modernization in terms of the room furniture. Will recommend and consider returning in future.",Executive Room,Business,yes
